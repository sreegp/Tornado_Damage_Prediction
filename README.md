# Tornado_Damage_Prediction

Trained logistic regression, decision tree and random forest models to predict tornado casualties

Performed data balancing, cross validation for tuning hyperparameters and evaluated best model using AUC value

Code is modularized for easy replication

Data processing ideas were discussed with Orion Taylor and Zane Dennis. Data processing code was a collaboration between me
and Orion Taylor. I modularized the code and added rest of the sections such as model selection and evaluation.
